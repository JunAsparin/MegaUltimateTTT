Ultra Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe!
A mega-scale twist on Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe â€” play across three layers of strategy with a 3x3 grid of 3x3 Ultimate boards, each containing 3x3 classic boards. Win smaller boards to move between larger ones and outsmart your opponent across the whole hierarchy.

How to Play:
The game starts in the center Ultimate board.

Inside each Ultimate board, you play a normal Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game (you move within mini-boards).

When a player wins a mini-board inside an Ultimate board, they unlock the next Ultimate board to play in, based on the position of the won mini-board.

You cannot move to another Ultimate board unless you win a mini-board.

The goal is to win three Ultimate boards in a row (like classic Tic-Tac-Toe).
